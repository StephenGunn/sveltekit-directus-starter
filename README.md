# sveltekit-directus-starter

This is my attempt to showcase two of my favorite technologies working together,
in a simple, understandable way.

I call this project a "starter" but it is also a proof-of-concept. There are definitely
more features than needed to be a starter.

Anyone and everyone is welcome to use the code from this project however they see fit.

## Goals of this project

- Create an easy to read and follow project structure
- Utilize SvelteKit's progressive enhancement to allow the app to work with
  JavaScript Disabled
- Everything is strongly typed using TypeScript
- Showcase of Diretus and some of it's most basic features

### .env

Please setup an .env file with this info:

```env
DIRECTUS_URL=
```

### Things to remember

-
- will need to import data for the demo to work.
